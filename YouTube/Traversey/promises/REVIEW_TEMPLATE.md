## Review:
Awesome quick crash course on promises and async / await. Definitely a beginner video yet did me well since I was having a hard time with the behavior of  `await`. From here, I would check out more complex examples of Promises as they are great to know. As a frontend developer, as he states, it's best to know how to work with them. As a backend developer, know how to use the Promise construcer (i.e `const promise = new Promise( (resolve resject ) => { ... })`)
