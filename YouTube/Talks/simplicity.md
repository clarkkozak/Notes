Please watch and re-watch this talk. 5/5 most view for any programmer.

Rich Hickey has the slides on his [Github](https://github.com/richhickey/slides)

Here are my quick notes:

## Simple

- one fold / brain
  - role
  - task
  - concept
- NOT
  - one instance, operations
- Simple is objective

## Easy

- Near at hand
  - familiar
  - near our capabilities
    - we can install something complex, but we donâ€™t understand it
- Easy is Relative

## Limits

- We can only think about a few things at a time
- intertwined things must be considered together
- complexity undermines understanding

## Change

- The growing elephant of the code you have already written
- Simple allows for thinking about the program

## Simplicity = Opportunity

- Let's use our brain.
- Design is about pulling apart
  - adapt simple parts of your program in other ways

_Do you want to be apart of the team that solves problems uniquely_

## Programmers vs Programs

- We focus on ourselves
  - Programmers convince
  - Replaceability
    - Your employer wants YOU to be homogenized
- We need to focus on our programs
  - This is what we do in the world
    - let's make software that's
- `gem install hairball`

Punch line:

We can create the same exact programs out of significantly simpler components

## List and Orders

- Does order matter?
- See where you can ask questions while coding to discover simplicity

## Maps / Hashes

- Use Them!
- See these
  - [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-implement-a-simple-hash-table-in-javascript-cb3b9c1f2997/) for JavaScript specifics
  - [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-map-and-set-objects-in-javascript)
  - `{}` or `new Map`

## Information

- It's simple, don't complicate it.
- Keep it key / value?
- This part confused me.

### Encapsulation

- Is for implementation details

## Can I Move It?

- Can you move your subsystems
- Without changing much
- The service has a verb

## Subsystems

- Didn't understand this as much either

## Simplicity is A Choice

- Everything else will change, this will not.
- Find entanglement, find complected items
- Don't lean on your tools
  - They don't care about your simplicity
  - You HAVE to choice your tools very well
    - do you REALLY need this

## Simplicity Matters

- It enables change
- Complexity inhabits understanding
- Don't drag the complexity elephant
