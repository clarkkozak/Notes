# [Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)

Rich Hickey has the slides on his [Github](https://github.com/richhickey/slides)

Here are my quick notes:

## Simple
  - one fold / brain
    - role
    - task
    - concept
  - NOT
    - one instance, operations
  - Simple is objective

## Easy
  - Near at hand
    - familiar
    - near our capabilities 
      - we can install something complex, but we donâ€™t understand it
  - Easy is Relative

## Limits
  - We can only think about a few things at a time
  - intertwined things must be considered together
  - complexity undermines understanding

## Change
  - The growing elephant of the code you have already written
  - Simple allows for thinking about the program

## Simplicity = Opportunity 
  - Let's use our brain. 
  - Design is about pulling apart 
    - adapt simple parts of your program in other ways
