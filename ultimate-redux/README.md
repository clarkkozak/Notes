## Rating:
4.5/5 stars

## Review:
WOW! I have been afraid of using redux since I got into React. It's such a great way to dive deeper into very important JavaScript AND software design concepts. Mosh shows that Redux brings computer science concepts to frontend web development. Highly suggested, give Mosh all of your money.
