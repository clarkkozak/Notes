## Review:
Good introduction course to Gatsby. It's a really cool software and I'll learn more since I want to build a Gastby + WordPress site some time.

I love the information about SEO and accesbility. I personality was looking for more of video around Gatsby and WordPress, yet it didn't go too indepth into the WordPress REST API or how to setup a headless WordPress for the backend. He used a pre-existing site.

Rangel Stoilov is a great teacher though, and goes over important beginner concepts. However, the code in the course doesn't translate well into real world applications.
