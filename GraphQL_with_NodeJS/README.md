## Review
Haider Malik is extremely enthuastic. Some people aren't as excited about these things and can be very plain when teaching. This is not the case with Haider. Great beginner course, highly recommended for anyone learning GraphQL. I decided not to write the code alongside this, as I have enough NodeJS and GraphQL experience. Additionally, I'll be going through a fullstack GraphQL shortly.
