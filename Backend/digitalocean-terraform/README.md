## Review
Awesome course on the basics of terraform. I needed a refresher and it set me up very well. Providers, variables, templates, AND free digital ocean credits! Dave Cohen is an amazing teacher and hope to review more of his courses. I like this code so much, I even tried to make a PR so other people find it.
