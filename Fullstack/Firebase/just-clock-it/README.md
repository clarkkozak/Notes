## Review:

Quick, easy, clean tutorial on how to use Firebase. Highly suggested for people's first step into Firebase. Helps to have some good understand of React Hooks, yet Baylor does a great job of explaining each step of the way. Watch it once, then code along with it. It'll make more sense the seoncd time.

I suggest playing around in Firebase's collectoin. There, you can see how many different types of conditions that can be made.
