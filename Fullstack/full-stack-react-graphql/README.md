<!-- Who, What, Why the rating?  -->
Really well done! I think this course is a great introduction to GraphQL for fullstack JavaScript developers. I decided not to write out this code since I'm currently not building things in class based components. However, if I or you do, this is definitely something one would want to go over more then once.

Lots of great React and GraphQL concepts like higher order components and optimistic UI.
