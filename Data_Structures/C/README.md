# DATA STRUCTURES AND PROGRAM DESIGN USING C
A Self-Teaching Introduction by Dheeraj Malhotra & Neha Malhotra

The first paragraph in the book really does it for me:

> A data structure is an efficient way of storing and organizing the data elements in the computer memory. Data means a value or a collection of values.  Structure refers to a method of organizing the data. The mathematical or logical representation of data in the memory is referred as a data structure. The objective of a data structure is to store, retrieve, and update the data efficiently. A data structure can be referred to as a group of elements grouped under one name. The group of data elements is called members, and they can be of different types.  Data structures are used in almost every program and software system. There are various kinds of data structures that are suited for different types of applications.  Data structures are the building blocks of a program. For a program to run efficiently, a programmer must choose appropriate data structures. A data structure is a very crucial part of data management. As the name suggests, data management is a task which includes different activities like collection of data, an organization of data into structures, and much more. Some examples where data structures are used include stacks, queues, arrays, binary trees, linked lists, hash tables, and so forth.

I'll need to read the entire first chapter because of how well it describes each summary of the data structures. For now, additionally, it jumps into basics of C programming, which I may do as well.


`"a good program refers to a program which runs correctly and efficiently by occupying less space in the memory, and also takes less time to run and execute."`

This is a what a good program is isolated in the world of software engineering. Yet as humans, we need to take a more holistic approach to what a good program reference to. A great program does what a good program does, and increases the love for life.
