# Data Structures

I'm learning data structures! I took a college level Data Structures course and thought "this is dumb. I don't want to learn this stuff."

Well, out of context, data structures is very silly. Just like music scales.

If you're a musician, or every played an instrument, a concert C major scale is one of the first things that is learned. And it's not a song. It's pretty silly.

Yet, it's fundamental. Lots of songs can be made with a C scale, a G scale, and D scale. The same goes for data structures.

When auditioning for a professional concert band, you need to know your scales. It's a great way to test how well you know your instrument. 

Data structures and their associated algorithms are like scales. They pretty simple on the surface yet solve a lot of problems. Without them you can't improvise like the pros. 

In an audition for a pro concert band, if you don't know your scales, you won't get into the band. Same goes for joining a software company. 

The comparison goes on. It isn't perfect, yet has justified my passion for data structures and their algorithms.
